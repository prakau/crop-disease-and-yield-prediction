# Crop Disease Detection and Yield Prediction

This project develops a deep learning-based system for accurate crop disease detection and yield prediction. The system utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained on large labeled datasets of crop leaf images to classify diseases. Additionally, it incorporates multi-modal data such as weather, soil moisture, and fertilizer usage to predict crop yields.

## Features

- Accurate crop disease detection and classification using CNNs
- Yield prediction based on various input parameters
- Transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques for improved performance
- User-friendly mobile app for farmers
- Potential for real-world impact in optimizing crop management
